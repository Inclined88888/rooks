/**
 * The cockpit's HTTP server.
 *
 * Next handles everything, with one exception: the WebSocket upgrades of the
 * built-in terminal (`lib/ui/terminal-ws-proxy.ts`). A Next route handler
 * never sees them (the `Request`/`Response` API does not expose the upgrade)
 * — hence this custom server, which relays those upgrades and hands
 * everything else to the Next handler.
 *
 * Started by `npm start` / `npm run dev` through tsx.
