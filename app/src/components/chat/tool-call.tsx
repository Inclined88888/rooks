 * name, its content behind a disclosure triangle. `full` is the same block
 * already open — for reading a whole turn without clicking. `stacked` shows
 * nothing but overlapping icons: a turn that called eleven tools becomes one
 * short row, which is what a newcomer needs to see that "it worked" without
 * being handed eleven JSON payloads.
 *
 * The three share ONE body renderer: what a mode changes is how the body is
