/**
 * The stand-in for a step that has not shipped yet: it hands over to
 * the screen that does the job today (`/login`, `/setup`, `/setup/agent`), so
 * the onboarding stays usable at every merge. A step with no such screen
 * (`href: null`) is skipped, in the direction the reader was going — or
 * "Back" could never get past it.
 *
 * A full navigation, not the router: the screens it opens start their own
 * document (the login replaces it after signing in), and a reload must land
 * there rather than back on this stand-in.
