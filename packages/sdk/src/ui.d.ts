 * Components are typed loosely on purpose: this package has no React

 * version). A plugin written in TypeScript with React installed can narrow
 * them itself:
 *
 *     import { Button } from '@timon/ui'
 *     const B = Button as React.FC<React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>>
 *
 * The list is frozen by `app/src/lib/plugin-host/contract-surface.json`: an
 * export may be added, never removed (see `docs/SDK-COMPAT.md`).
