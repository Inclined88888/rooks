name: rooks-export
description: Export your agents (Hermes profiles, Grok Bot Bots and groups, or yourself) into one zip that Rooks imports. Use when the user asks to export their agents for Rooks, to move their agents to Rooks, or to make a Rooks agent archive.
---

# Export agents for Rooks

You are about to pack the user's agents into **one `.zip` file** that Rooks
reads in **Import agents › Grok Bot, Hermes or another agent**. The archive
holds a single JSON file, `rooks-agent-import.json`, in the exact format
described below. Rooks shows the user a preview of everything before it
writes anything.

## Rules that never bend

- **No secret value, ever.** API keys, tokens, passwords, cookies, session
  ids, private URLs with credentials: never copy their value anywhere in the
  archive, not even in a warning. A secret travels by its **name** only
  (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `Authorization`), in a `secretNames` list.
- **Read, do not change.** You only read the user's agents. Do not edit,
  move or delete anything of theirs, and do not run their scripts.
- **Ask before you pack.** List what you found and let the user choose.
- **The format is strict.** Every object accepts only the fields listed here.
  An unknown field, a wrong type or a value past its limit makes Rooks refuse
  the whole archive. Leave a field out rather than guess.

## Step 1 — Find the agents

### In Hermes

1. Find the Hermes home: the folder named by the `HERMES_HOME` environment
   variable when it is set; otherwise `~/.hermes` on Linux and macOS, and
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` on Windows (then `%USERPROFILE%\.hermes` if that
   one does not exist).
2. Each profile is one agent. The home itself is the profile `default`; each
   folder `<home>/profiles/<name>` is the profile `<name>`.
3. Per profile, read only these files (paths relative to the profile folder):
   - `SOUL.md`: the identity. Drop its HTML comments (`<!-- … -->`); if only
     headings are left, it is empty.
   - `memories/USER.md` and `memories/MEMORY.md`: entries separated by `§`.
     Each non-empty entry is one memory: `preference` for `USER.md`,
     `decision` for `MEMORY.md`.
   - `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md`: one
     skill each. Skip hidden folders and the skills named in
     `skills/.bundled_manifest` (one `name:hash` per line, shipped with Hermes).
   - `cron/jobs.json`: the scheduled jobs (a list, or `{ "jobs": [...] }`).
   - `config.yaml`: `model` (a string, or `{ provider, default }` →
     `provider/default`), `timezone`, and `mcp_servers`.
   - `.env`: the variable **names** only, never the values.
   - Whether `state.db` or `sessions/` exists: that is a history, which Rooks
     does not import (`hints.hasHistory: true`).

### In Grok Bot

1. List the Bots and the groups you can see: for each Bot its name, title,
   description (its job), its instructions, the skills it uses, its routines
   (instruction, when to run, time zone, paused or active), what it remembers,
   and its picture if you can read it. For each group: its name and members.
2. If you can only see yourself, export yourself, and tell the user to ask
   each other Bot the same thing. Rooks imports several archives one after
   the other.
3. A routine started by an event (Slack, email, GitHub, a webhook…) cannot be
   carried: name it in `warnings`.

### In any other agent tool

Export yourself: your name, your role or title, your identity and
instructions, what you remember about the user, your text skills, your
scheduled tasks and your MCP servers.

## Step 2 — Ask which agents to export

Show the user the list (name and one line each) and ask which ones to export:
all of them, or some. Export only what they chose.

## Step 3 — Write the manifest

One JSON object, UTF-8, at most **10 MiB**. Its top level:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `format` | always `"rooks-agent-import"` |
| `version` | always `1` |
| `source` | `{ "app": "<app>", "exportedAt": "<now, ISO 8601 with offset>" }`. `app` is `"hermes"` for Hermes, `"grok-bot"` for Grok Bot, otherwise a short lowercase name of your tool (`a-z`, `0-9`, `-`). Rooks names the agents `<app>.<key>`. |
| `agents` | 1 to 100 agents (below). |
| `groups` | optional, up to 100 groups (below). |
| `warnings` | optional, up to 200 sentences of at most 500 characters: what you could not carry, in plain words. |

### An agent

| Field | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | yes | lowercase `a-z`, `0-9` and `-`, 1 to 64 characters, starting and ending with a letter or digit. Unique in the manifest. |
| `displayName` | yes | 1 to 100 characters. |
| `sourceRef` | yes | the agent's stable id at the source, unique, at most 300 characters. Always the same for the same agent: Rooks updates the agent it already imported instead of creating a copy. |
| `title` | no | at most 120 characters. |
| `soul` | no | who the agent is (becomes its `SOUL.md`), at most 200,000 characters. |
| `instructions` | no | its working instructions (its system prompt), at most 200,000 characters. |
| `directives` | no | extra directives, at most 20,000 characters. |
| `docs` | no | up to 32 documents `{ "name", "content" }`: `name` ends in `.md` (letters, digits, `_`, `.`, `-`, at most 99 characters, not `system-prompt.md`), `content` 1 to 200,000 characters. Names are unique. |
| `memories` | no | up to 256 `{ "text", "kind" }`: `text` 1 to 4,000 characters, `kind` one of `preference`, `decision`, `pitfall`. |
| `skills` | no | up to 200 `{ "id", "content" }` (below). |
| `routines` | no | up to 64 routines (below). |
| `mcpServers` | no | up to 64 servers (below). |
| `avatar` | no | `{ "mime", "dataBase64" }`: `mime` one of `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`; the picture in standard base64 (no `data:` prefix, no line breaks), at most 2 MiB once decoded. |
| `hints` | no | `{ "model", "deliveries", "secretNames", "hasHistory" }`, all optional: `model` at most 200 characters; `deliveries` up to 32 platform names (`telegram`, `discord`…); `secretNames` up to 64 names of the secrets the agent used; `hasHistory` `true` when there is a conversation history. |

A **skill** is `{ "id", "content" }` and, when the skill folder holds more
than its `SKILL.md`, `"companionFiles"` (their relative paths, up to 200) and
`"hasCode": true` when one of them is a script. `id` is lowercase `a-z`,
`0-9`, `.`, `_`, `-`, 1 to 100 characters (the folder name, lowercased);
`content` is the whole `SKILL.md` text, at most 1 MiB. Rooks imports
text-only skills and lists the others.

A **routine** is `{ "name", "instruction", "schedule", "timezone",
"enabledInSource" }`: `name` 1 to 80 characters, `instruction` (what the agent
is asked to do) 1 to 100,000 characters, `timezone` an IANA zone such as
`Europe/Paris` or `null`, `enabledInSource` `true` when it is active at the
source. Leave out a job that runs a script instead of asking the agent. The
`schedule` is exactly one of:

| `schedule` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{ "kind": "cron", "expression": "0 9 * * 1-5" }` | a 5-field cron expression |
| `{ "kind": "interval", "minutes": 120 }` | every N minutes, 1 to 527,040 |
| `{ "kind": "hourly", "minute": 15 }` | every hour at that minute (`minute` optional, 0–59) |
| `{ "kind": "daily", "time": "08:00" }` | every day, `HH:MM` 24-hour |
| `{ "kind": "weekdays", "time": "08:00" }` | Monday to Friday |
| `{ "kind": "weekly", "days": ["mon", "thu"], "time": "18:30" }` | 1 to 7 days: `sun`…`sat`, full names, or 0–7 (0 and 7 are Sunday) |
| `{ "kind": "monthly", "day": 1, "time": "09:00" }` | day 1 to 31 of each month |
| `{ "kind": "once", "at": "2026-12-24T18:00:00+01:00" }` | one run, ISO 8601 with offset (shown, not scheduled) |

An **MCP server** is `{ "name", "transport", … }`: `name` 1 to 100
characters, `transport` `"http"` or `"stdio"`. An `http` server has `url`
(at most 2,048 characters) **without** user name, password, or any query
parameter or path segment that holds a secret. A `stdio` server has
`command` and `args` with every secret value replaced by `<redacted>`. In
both, `secretNames` lists the names of the headers and environment variables
it needs. Leave out a server that is turned off.

### A group

`{ "key", "name", "members", "color" }`: `key` like an agent key, `name` 1 to
160 characters, `members` the `key`s of agents **in this manifest** (up to
100), `color` optional. Rooks makes each group a team. A group's lead, own
instructions, routines and memories have no place there: say so in
`warnings`.

### How each source fills it

| | Hermes | Grok Bot |
|---|---|---|
| `source.app` | `hermes` | `grok-bot` |
| `key` | the profile name, lowercased, every run of other characters turned into `-` (`default` stays `default`) | the Bot's name, the same way |
| `displayName` | `Hermes` for `default`, the profile name otherwise | the Bot's name |
| `sourceRef` | `profile:<profile name>` | `grok-bot:<the Bot's id, or its key>` |
| `soul` | `SOUL.md` without comments | name, title and description |
| `memories` | `USER.md` → `preference`, `MEMORY.md` → `decision` | what it remembers → `preference` |
| `routines` | `cron/jobs.json`: `prompt` → `instruction`; `schedule` `{kind: cron, expr}` → `cron`, `{kind: interval, minutes}` → `interval`; `enabled` and `state` → `enabledInSource`; the `timezone` of `config.yaml` | its routines, their time zone, active or paused |
| `mcpServers` | `mcp_servers` of `config.yaml` | the apps it uses, when they are MCP servers |
| `hints.secretNames` | the names in `.env` | the names of the secrets it uses |

## Step 4 — Check it

Before you pack, check every rule above: no unknown field, every required
field present, the limits respected, keys and `sourceRef`s unique, every
group member a key of the manifest. Search the whole JSON one last time for a
secret value: there must be none. If the file is over 10 MiB, drop the
pictures first.

## Step 5 — Make the zip

Name it `rooks-agents-<app>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.zip` (`rooks-agents-hermes-2026-11-03.zip`),
with `-2`, `-3`… when that name is taken. `rooks-agent-import.json` sits at
the **root** of the zip, not in a folder.

Put it in the user's Downloads folder: `~/Downloads` on macOS, Windows
(`%USERPROFILE%\Downloads`) and Linux (or the folder `xdg-user-dir DOWNLOAD`
prints). Write it as `<name>.zip.part` first, then rename it to `<name>.zip`,
so that Rooks never sees a half-written file. With Python:

```python
import os, zipfile
target = os.path.join(downloads, name)   # downloads and name chosen above
with zipfile.ZipFile(target + ".part", "w", zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zf:
    zf.writestr("rooks-agent-import.json", manifest_json)   # the text, UTF-8
os.replace(target + ".part", target)
```

**You work on a computer that is not the user's** (Grok Bot's cloud computer,
a remote server): make the zip there, then attach it to the conversation so
the user downloads it.

## Step 6 — Tell the user

Say where the zip is, how many agents it holds, and what you left out. Then:
in Rooks, **Import agents**, the card **Grok Bot, Hermes or another agent**,
pick the zip, check the preview, then import. From a terminal:
`rooks agent import <the zip>`. The secrets have to be entered again in Rooks:
list their names.
