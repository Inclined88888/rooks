/**
 * Prepares the Node runtime and the native dependencies that travel inside
 * the package (5.6.1/5.6.6).
 *
 * The packaged daemon, and the Next app it spawns, run on the Node the package
 * ships in `resources/node` (`fetch-node.mjs`, version pinned in
 * `node-runtime.json`), no longer on Electron's own Node: Electron 33's Node 20
 * has no `node:sqlite`, which third-party plugins need. The natives are built,
 * and checked, for that Node's module ABI. The host's Node may differ (Windows
 * builder on Node 24 → ABI 137): an artefact compiled for it fails at the first
 * `require`, the daemon crash-loops, and the shell shows "The daemon keeps
 * crashing". `node-pty` (terminals) and the app's own `better-sqlite3` (remote
 * API) are in the same situation.
 *
 * `electron-builder install-app-deps` does NOT fix this: it rebuilds the
 * dependencies of the `desktop/` package, which has none — the native module
 * belongs to another package that electron-builder only copies as a resource.
 *
 * Rebuilding `orchestrator/node_modules` in place is FORBIDDEN: the daemon the maintainer
 * runs from this repo (plain Node 22, systemd) loads that very file and would
 * break the moment we swap its ABI. So we work on a COPY:
 *
 *   <tree>/{package.json,package-lock.json,node_modules}
 *     → desktop/build-resources/<tree>/…   (rebuilt for the shipped Node's ABI)
 *
 * and `electron-builder.yml` ships that copy instead of the live tree.
