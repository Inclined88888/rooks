; Windows installer hook (step 5.7.2).
;
; This file no longer REGISTERS the daemon service, and that is the point.
;
; It did until 12/09/2026, by calling `timon service install` from
; `customInstall`. At that instant no `timon.config.json` exists yet, so the
; CLI answered with the daemon's built-in defaults — which describe a developer
; machine. The registered task therefore ran the daemon on port 3000 with
; `app.enabled = false` and `profile = linux-desktop`: a service that serves no
; UI, on a port the desktop shell does not look at, while the first-run screen
; reported "the service is installed" and refused to install the real one.
;
; The installer cannot know those values. The shell decides them on the first
; launch (3010 / 3110, portable until the user says otherwise) and the first-run
; screen registers the service once they exist — with the right ports, the right
; profile and the durable runtime path. That screen already installs, already
; explains, and already blocks until the service answers. One place, informed,
; instead of two, one of them guessing.
;
; Uninstall still removes the task: whoever registered it, it must not outlive
; the application. `timon service uninstall` leaves TIMON_HOME — missions,
; agents, database — exactly where the user left it. The invariant is enforced
; in the CLI; it is repeated here because this file is far from the code that
; holds it. The CLI runs on the Node the package ships (resources\node), so no
; Node installation is required on the machine. The app's executable itself no
; longer runs as Node (RunAsNode fuse off): without that Node, only the direct
; cleanup below remains.
;
; The payload unpacks to ~500 MB over tens of thousands of files, and an install
; that crawls between two percents for minutes reads as a freeze — it was
; reported stuck at 60% on 12/09/2026. Showing the file list is NOT the answer,
; tempting as it looks: `installSection.nsh` opens on `SetDetailsPrint none`,
; and the payload travels through `Nsis7z::Extract` then `CopyFiles /SILENT`,
; neither of which names a file. `ShowInstDetails show` would only open an empty
; white box for the whole extraction — a worse signal than the bar on its own.
; `hide` puts it behind a "show details" button instead.

; The Timon service runs under a Task Scheduler S4U logon, in session 0. A
; per-user installer cannot end those Timon.exe, and the stock check looped on
; "Timon cannot be closed" (0.1.2-rc.2 update, 27/09/2026). rc.3 tried to detect
; them with `tasklist /FI "SESSION eq 0"` from the unelevated installer and saw
; nothing. So no detection any more: whenever Timon is already installed or a
; service launcher exists, the installer asks for elevation as it opens, and
; timon-service-pause.ps1 pauses the service until the installer exits.
