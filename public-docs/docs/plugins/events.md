title: Listening to events
sidebar_position: 13.9
---

Your plugin follows what happens in Rooks by listening to events: `ctx.events.on(kind, handler)` in the host half, `ctx.events.subscribe(kind, handler)` in the browser half. Both return a function that stops listening; Rooks also stops every listener when your plugin unloads. Events are read-only: a plugin never emits one on Rooks's bus. Your own events go through [business events](integrations.md#business-events) or [live updates](realtime.md).

Every kind needs `events:subscribe`. Most also need the read permission of what they carry, because receiving the object is reading it. A kind that is not in the table below throws when you subscribe, and the message lists the allowed kinds.

```json
"rooks": {
  "id": "acme-watch",
  "apiVersion": 10,
  "permissions": ["events:subscribe", "kanban:read"]
}
```

| `workflow_proposal` | nothing | `workflowId`, `missionId` | yes | [below](#signals) |
| `mission_started`, `turn_complete`, `mission_title_changed` | `missions:read` | the mission and the `origin` of the change | yes | [Controlling missions](missions-control.md#events) |
| `event`, `event_delta` | `missions:transcript` | a transcript row; a live fragment of an answer | `event` only | [Controlling missions](missions-control.md#events) |
| `task_created`, `task_updated`, `task_assigned`, `task_deleted`, `task_unblocked` | `kanban:read` | the task, `changed` and `previous` for an update, `origin` | no | [Kanban sync](kanban-sync.md#hear-the-changes) |
| `todo_done`, `todo_resolved`, `todo_deleted` | `todos:read` | the idea, `origin` | no | [Permissions](permissions.md#keeping-a-to-do-idea-and-a-ticket-in-step) |
| `ui_document_created`, `ui_document_resolved` | `ui-documents:read` | the document, its creator or the answer | no | [Documents in the conversation](ui-documents.md) |
| `question_pending`, `question_resolved` | `questions:read` | the question, `origin` | no | [Questions and notifications](questions-notifications.md#events) |
| `memory_rule_added`, `memory_rule_removed` | `memory:read` | a rule your plugin wrote, `origin` | no | [Memory](memory.md) |
| `project_created`, `project_updated` | `projects:read` (or `projects:manage`) | the project, `changed`, `origin` | no | [Projects, series and worktrees](projects-series-worktrees.md) |
| `agent_created`, `agent_updated`, `agent_deleted` | `agents:read` | an agent your plugin created, `origin` | no | [Agents](agents.md) |
| `routine_*`, `trigger_*`, `pipeline_*`, `workflow_run_started`, `workflow_run_cancelled` | the entity's read permission | the object, `origin` | no | [Automations](automations.md#events) |
| `browser_recording_*` | `browser:recordings:read` (or `:write`) | the recording's metadata, `origin` | no | [The built-in browser](browser.md#recordings) |
| `browser_annotation_*` | `browser:annotations:read` (or `:write`) | the annotation's metadata, `origin` | no | [The built-in browser](browser.md#annotations) |

`origin` is `{ kind, id }` and says who made the change: `user`, `agent`, `plugin`, `system`, or the channel that started a mission. A change your plugin made carries `{ kind: 'plugin', id: ctx.id }`: a sync ignores that echo.

```js
ctx.events.on('task_updated', (ev) => {
  if (ev.origin.kind === 'plugin' && ev.origin.id === ctx.id) return   // your own write
  if (ev.changed.includes('status')) console.log(ev.task.id, ev.previous.status, '→', ev.task.status)
})
```

The kinds with a permission of their own reach your plugin for the objects of the users allowed to use it, inside that user's identity (`ctx.user()`), and for the objects your plugin owns. Their handlers run one at a time per plugin, in event order.

## Signals

The first six kinds are signals: they carry identifiers, never the object, and need nothing but `events:subscribe`.

- **In the host half** they reach your plugin for **every account** of the installation, and the handler runs outside any request. To read what changed, call the matching façade (`ctx.missions.get`, `ctx.kanban.get`, `ctx.notifications.list`, `ctx.workflows.status`): outside a request it answers like a background job, so it sees only what your plugin owns. Do not use these identifiers to tell anyone what happened in another account's work.
- **In the browser half** they come from the signed-in user's stream, so they only carry what that user can see. `notifications_changed` reaches an account for its own notifications.

```js
// Browser half: refresh a badge when this user's notifications change.
const stop = ctx.events.subscribe('notifications_changed', () => reloadBadge())
```

What each one means:

| Event | Sent when |
| --- | --- |
| `mission_complete` | a mission's process ended. `failed` and `terminated` differ: a failure of the agent, or a stop (a person, a limit, a shutdown). A conversation that stays open sends `turn_complete` at the end of each turn instead. |
| `task_done`, `task_blocked` | a Kanban task closed as done or blocked. `task_updated` (with `kanban:read`) says the same with the task and the `origin`. |
| `notifications_changed` | a notification was created, read or dismissed. `ownerUserId` is the account it belongs to (`null` for a system notification); `notificationId` is set on a creation only. Read the list again rather than guessing what changed. |
| `workflow_run` | a workflow run or one of its nodes changed status. `nodeId` is absent for the run itself. |
| `workflow_proposal` | an agent proposed changes to a workflow from a mission. The proposal waits for a person to accept it in the workflow editor; accepting replaces the draft, it never publishes. |

Handle them as invalidations: reload what you show, and expect several in a burst.

## Handlers that fail

A handler that throws or rejects is your plugin's own failure: the daemon logs it under your plugin's id, the other listeners of the event still run, and the write that caused the event is not affected ([Manifest](manifest.md)). Catch what you can recover from.
