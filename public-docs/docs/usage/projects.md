A project associates a working directory with its agents and default roles. Use it to keep work aimed at the right repository and to give coding, review and coordination tasks suitable workers.

1. Register the project from the project controls and choose its existing directory.
2. Associate agents with it, using paths on the **daemon host**.
3. Set the agent, backend/model and permission defaults for each role you use.
4. Create a small task and check that its assignee and working directory match the project.

Use **Browse…** beside the working directory when creating or editing a
project to choose a folder on the machine running Rooks. In the desktop app on
this computer it opens your system's folder picker; connected to another
machine, or in a web browser, it lists the folders of that machine instead
(**Hidden folders** shows the ones starting with a dot). Cancelling keeps the
current path. You can always type the path directly.

If Rooks cannot use the working directory, the project card says why instead of showing "no working directory": **folder not found** (the path does not exist on the computer running Rooks), **access denied** with the system error code (on macOS, check System Settings › Privacy & Security for folders such as Documents or Desktop), or **not a folder**. The registered path is shown next to the reason. As the owner you may still save a path that does not exist yet; Rooks warns you when you do.

Inspect project configuration from the CLI:

```bash
rooks project list
rooks project roles PROJECT_SLUG
```

To assign an existing agent to a role:

```bash
rooks project set-role PROJECT_SLUG code PROJECT_AGENT
```

To register or edit a project from the terminal, and to see the workspaces (poles) it can belong to:

```bash
rooks workspace list
rooks project create acme-app --name "Acme" --cwd /srv/acme --workspace "Design Studio"
rooks project update acme-app --speech "Customer portal"
```

The directory must already exist on the machine. A workspace you name must exist too; add `--create-workspace` to create it. An empty value (`--speech ""`) clears a field.

The project role is the normal default for a task; task-specific overrides are useful for exceptions. A project path is not a container path unless the daemon actually executes inside that container.

## Docker containers

When a project's directory runs a Docker Compose stack, the project card and the chat's **Docker** widget show its containers, their local address, and **Start**, **Stop**, **Restart** and **Rebuild** buttons, for the whole stack or one container.

**Start** restarts the existing containers as they were created. If they were created on a Docker network that has since been deleted or renamed (moving a reverse proxy from `traefik_network` to `proxy_net`, for instance), Rooks recreates them with `docker compose up -d` on the networks of the current Compose file. If that fails too, the error names the missing network: fix the networks declared in the Compose file, then click **Rebuild**.

## Deleting a project

Open the project's edit window and use **Delete** in the danger zone. If the project still has agents, Rooks asks what to do with them:

- **Move them to another project**: they keep their names and memory and join the project you pick. An agent that worked in the old project's folder now works in the new project's folder.
- **Detach them**: they stay, with no project.
- **Delete them**: their identity and memory are erased. This cannot be undone.

The project's folder under your Rooks home is removed with the project; your own working directory is never touched.

## Git isolation

A coding task's worktree has its own branch and files. The final merge integrates that branch into the chosen base. Check the task's worktree information before editing or integrating: sharing a project does not mean sharing one working directory.

Databases, credentials and services outside the repository remain shared. Coordinate changes to those resources separately from Git changes.

The chat's [Git widget](git.md) shows a project's branches, its commit graph with every worktree, and its remotes.
