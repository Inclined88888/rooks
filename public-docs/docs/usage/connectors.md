title: Official connectors — connect your services in one click
sidebar_position: 2.6

The **official connectors** are the MCP servers of services your agents can work with, such as GitHub, Linear, Notion, Sentry, Stripe or Supabase. Each one is hosted by the service's own publisher. Connecting it takes one click and a sign-in on the publisher's site: you never copy an address or edit a configuration file.

They open the **Connectors** tab of **Capabilities**, above the MCP servers you added yourself, grouped by category (Code, Data, Design, Productivity, Payments), connected ones first. The tab's search box filters connectors and your own servers at once. On a wide screen, a column on the left lists the categories and your own servers: click one to jump to it. Click a connector to see a few examples of requests, how it connects, what it does, and links to the publisher's website, privacy policy and terms of use.

The section is provided by the **Official connectors** plugin, on by default (**Settings → Plugins**).

## Connect a connector

Each connector connects in one of three ways:

- **Sign-in with the publisher** (most connectors). Press **Connect**. The publisher's sign-in page opens in a new tab, or in your system browser in the desktop app. Sign in, approve access, and come back. The card switches to **Connected** within a few seconds. If the page did not open, for example because the browser blocked it, open the card and choose **Open the sign-in page again**.
- **A key** (GitHub, for example). Open the card, paste the key in the masked field, then press **Connect**. The **Get a key** link opens the publisher's page that issues it. For GitHub, use a fine-grained personal access token: the token decides which repositories and actions your agents can reach. Timon keeps the key in its secrets vault, where it appears in **Settings → Secrets** as `MCP_APP_GITHUB_KEY`. No agent receives the key itself, and Timon sends it only to that connector. If the vault is switched off, a key connector cannot be connected.
- **No account** (Context7, for example). Press **Connect** and the connector is ready.

Connecting creates an MCP server named `app-<name>`, for example `app-linear`. It also appears under **Your MCP servers**, below the connectors: it is an MCP server like the others.

## Give a connector to an agent

Connecting makes the connector available, but no agent has it yet. Add it to an agent from the **MCP** tab of the agent editor, or switch it on in the MCP card of the chat sidebar. The agent receives its tools the next time it starts.

Agents running on a backend that only loads local MCP servers do not receive connectors, since every connector is a remote server.

## Disconnect a connector

Open the card and press **Disconnect**. Its MCP server is removed, and so is its key if it has one. Agents that used it lose its tools the next time they start. To revoke the access you granted at sign-in, also remove it from your account settings on the publisher's site.

If you added an MCP server called `app-<name>` by hand, the matching card shows **Name taken**. Timon never changes or removes that server. Rename or delete it under **Your MCP servers** to use the connector.

## Add a server that is not in the list

**New MCP**, in the tab's toolbar, opens the MCP server form. There you can add any MCP server: a remote address with its own headers, or a program that runs on your machine.

## What a connector receives

A connector receives what your agents send it: the requests they make and the data they include. The publisher processes that data under its own privacy policy and terms, linked from each card. Timon only lists servers whose publisher is verified by the official MCP registry. Each one is reviewed before it ships, and its address and sign-in are checked. The publishers' logos ship with Timon, so nothing is loaded from a publisher's site to display them.

Who can connect connectors: an account that holds the `mcp:manage` permission (administrators by default). Agents cannot connect or disconnect one, because a connector acts with your own account at the publisher.
