/**
 * Garbage collector of the task worktrees and branches.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * `disposeWorktree()` has existed since the beginning, but NOTHING in the orchestrator
 * calls it: it relies on the merger agent, supposed to think of it at the end of the task.
 * When it forgets, when the chain breaks before the merge, or when the task is
 * closed by hand, the worktree and its branch remain — forever. Observed
 * on 2026-08-05: 9 leftover worktrees and 11 leftover branches, all on tasks
 * DONE for weeks.
 *
 * That is not fixed by reminding the agent to clean up (it was already written
 * in the skill, it was not enough) but by declaring the invariant and
 * reconciling it: a finished task whose work is integrated no longer has a
 * worktree.
 *
 * ## The absolute guard
 *
 * A branch whose commits are not already present in the base is NEVER
 * deleted. A lingering worktree costs a few MB; deleted work
 * does not come back. Any unintegrated branch is left in place and reported,
 * whatever its age or the status of its task.
