/**
 * Lifecycle of the questions an agent asks the human (`question`, `kanban_plan`
 * — the `ask_user` cards of `permissions.ts`), for the readers that are not the
 * conversation: the plugin events `question_pending` / `question_resolved`.
 *
 * The mission transcript carries `permission_*` events whose payloads are not
 * enough to rebuild a card once it is gone (the resolved one has no questions),
 * and `event` bus kinds are never relayed to a plugin. `permissions.ts` hands
 * this emitter a SNAPSHOT of the card at the moment of the write instead, so a
 * subscriber sees exactly what that write saw — the same reason the TO DO and
 * document events are translated synchronously.
