/**
 * One daemon per data directory.
 *
 * A second daemon started on a `ROOKS_HOME` another one already serves used to boot in full before
 * failing to listen: on the way it marked the first daemon's live missions failed, armed a reaper
 * and touched the licence, then exited on `EADDRINUSE` and was relaunched by its supervisor, which
 * did it all over again. The first-run assistant died of exactly that: the service installed from
 * `/setup` killed the setup mission of the embedded daemon every ten seconds, and its MCP tools
 * answered 401.
 *
 * The lock is SQLite's own exclusive lock on `<home>/daemon.lock` — `LockFileEx` on Windows,
 * `fcntl` elsewhere, the mechanism `data-open-lock.ts` already relies on. The OS drops it when its
 * process ends, however it ends: a crash never leaves a lock to clear, and a recycled pid cannot
 * pass for the holder, because nothing here asks whether a pid is alive. `daemon.lock.json` only
 * tells the refused daemon whom to name; it is never read to decide.
