/**
 * "Usage limit reached" detection on a NORMALISED event, for every
 * dialect.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE: the same question was settled in two places with
 * two different vocabularies.
 *   - `agent.ts` (live stream) knew the three shapes: `rate_limit_event`,
 *     `result` in 429, and the text message a dialect without a structured
 *     status produces.
 *   - `db.ts` (after-the-fact autopsy, `detectMissionDeathSignal`) only knew
 *     the first two — that is the vocabulary of a single dialect.
 * Consequence: a mission killed by the quota on a backend that only reports
 * text died WITHOUT a signal, so its task went back to a silent BLOCKED. Very
 * exactly the incident `interruption.ts` was written to eliminate, left
 * open for the other backends.
 *
 * The rules apply to EVERY dialect, without a name test: they are
 * mutually exclusive (a dialect that emits no `rate_limit_event`
 * will never see one), and a new family of CLIs automatically inherits
 * the textual rule. The `Dialect.rateLimitReporting` capability therefore does NOT drive
 * the detection — it DESCRIBES what can be expected of a dialect, and that is
 * what allows saying of a silent death that it is `unknown` rather than
 * "not a rate limit" (see `interruption.ts`). Necessary, because
 * the autopsy (`db.ts`) works on persisted events whose original backend
 * is no longer reliably known.
 *
 * Shape reminder: every backend rewrites its native stream into
 * ROOKS's normalised event vocabulary (`system` / `assistant` / `result` /
 * `rate_limit_event`), which is what makes a single detection possible.
 */

/**
 * What is known about a limit reached.
 *
 * `window` and `resetsAt` are null when the dialect does not expose them
