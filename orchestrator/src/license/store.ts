/**
 * `~/.timon/license.state.json` — everything the daemon must remember about
 * its licence besides the token itself (SECU-LICENCES L-1, L-5, L-7):
 *
 *   - `every` / `offlineHours`: the refresh schedule the SERVER announced on
 *     activation (`refresh` of §5.1). Never hard-coded: the server may tighten
 *     or loosen it per plan without shipping a daemon.
 *   - `lastContact`: last successful `activate` / `renew`, Unix seconds. The
 *     offline tolerance counts from here, and survives a restart with it.
 *   - `maxSrv`: highest server clock ever accepted. A token whose `srv` is
 *     below it was issued BEFORE one we already trusted: either a replay or a
 *     local clock wound back to resurrect an old token (L-5).
 *   - `lastSeen`: highest local clock ever observed. A boot whose clock is a
 *     day behind it is a wound-back clock, not a drift.
 *   - `clockHigh`: highest local clock a BETA build ever judged its own end
 *     date against (`build-policy.ts`), written on every evaluation rather
 *     than on token acceptance like `lastSeen`. A build that has seen its
 *     `expiresAt` stays expired when the clock is wound back afterwards.
 *   - `machineName` / `machineNameLocked`: the name this install gave itself
 *     (§5.10). Remembered HERE because nowhere else carries it: the name is
 *     not a token claim, and `409 name_locked` sends no name back. So the
 *     daemon knows the name only from its own accepted write, and knows
 *     "already named, by someone else" only from that 409 — two states worth
 *     telling apart, since the second must not offer a field that would fail.
 *   - `machineNameLicense`: the `lic` the name was recorded under. Kept next
 *     to the name rather than read from the live state, because the live state
 *     is `expired` exactly when someone hand-installs a fresher token — the
 *     moment we most need to answer "same licence, or another one?".
 *
 * Written atomically (`tmp` + `rename`) like the token; `0600`; zone `secrets`.
