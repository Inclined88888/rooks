/**
 * `http` service — the Express application shared by the modules.
 *
 * Cordis knows nothing about HTTP: this service is our addition. It exposes the
 * Express app under `ctx.http` and provides `ctx.http.router()`, which creates a `Router`,
 * mounts it, and registers its removal as an effect of the CALLING module. That is what
 * makes a route reversible: unloading a module removes its routes, without a
 * restart.
 *
 * Why a service method and not a `ctx.router()` function set by
 * `ctx.provide`: a function does not know who calls it, so its effect
 * would hook onto the fiber of `@timon/http` and the routes would only leave at
 * that fiber's death. A `Service` method sees in `this.ctx` the context
 * of the caller (Cordis context tracing) — the effect lands in the right
 * place.
 *
 * Unmounting goes through a shell: Express has no `app.unuse`, and
 * hacking at `app._router.stack` breaks with every version. The mounted router therefore
 * stays in place and becomes an inert pass-through when its owner leaves.
 *
 * Route claims (audit #8): Express resolves a path with the FIRST router that
 * matches it, so two modules registering the same method+path silently shadow
 * each other — and the winner depends on load order. That is a permission bug
 * waiting to happen (an unguarded route hiding a guarded one). Every router
 * handed out by `router()` therefore claims its method+path, and a second
 * claim throws at registration time: the module fails to apply, the activation
 * audit names it, and the daemon refuses to start. Loud beats silent.
