/**
 * Child process supervisor — the relaunch mechanics shared by the
 * modules that launch a long-running binary (`web-app`, `telegram`).
 *
 * Extracted verbatim from `plugins-bundled/web-app/index.ts` (step 3.1) on
 * the occasion of step 3.2, which needs the same thing for two more
 * children. The behaviour is identical word for word: the `web-app` tests
 * pass without modification, which is what proves the extraction.
 *
 * What the supervisor does NOT do, on purpose:
 *  - it builds no environment. `spawn.env` REPLACES the child's
 *    environment (Node does not merge): each caller decides whether it wants
 *    a minimal environment (web-app, which only calls absolute paths)
 *    or `{ ...process.env, … }` (telegram and uvx, which need PATH, HOME
 *    and the secrets already exported);
 *  - it does not decide whether the module must run. That is `apply`'s business.
