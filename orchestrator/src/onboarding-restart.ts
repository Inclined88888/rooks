/**
 * Onboarding step 5 — the restart, which is no longer optional.
 *
 * `rooks.config.json` is read ONCE, at boot: the daemon that wrote it during
 * setup is still running on the defaults the wizard just replaced. Until now
 * the restart was advice at the bottom of a confirmation dialog, with a "later"
 * button next to it — so the normal ending of onboarding was a cockpit served
 * by a daemon that knew nothing about the configuration its owner had just
 * chosen. Pinned binaries invisible, modules still at their defaults, and every
 * symptom blamed on the wrong thing.
 *
 * It is now the last step of the wizard, and the first-run gate holds there.
 * Which means "has it restarted?" must be answerable, and unfakeable by a
 * browser reload:
 *
 *   The pending marker holds the BOOT ID of the process that wrote the config.
 *   A process compares it to its own. Equal → this is still that very process,
 *   the restart has not happened. Different (or absent) → a new process is
 *   serving, which is exactly what the step was waiting for.
 *
 * Nothing is written at boot, so the check self-heals: a home carried to
 * another machine, a daemon killed mid-step, a value left over from an install
 * that never finished — all answer "not pending" on the next process.
