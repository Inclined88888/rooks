/**
 * Cap on ordinary mission-bound `api_tokens` row (secu-3 / AUDIT-SECU #3).
 *
 * An ordinary spawned agent authenticates as its launcher but does not inherit
 * `isSuperadmin` or `*`. The snapshot is this list ∩ the launcher's
 * grants (a superadmin's implicit `*` yields the whole cap). Kanban reads /
 * notify / mission GET stay owner-scoped rather than `rejectIfDenied`
 * so plugin/system tokens and the Employee preset keep working; the cap
 * is what `requestHasPermission` sees when a route does check. Writing a
 * task (`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/tasks`, a TO DO promotion) does check
 * `kanban:write` since TODO #752: owner scoping alone let a `kanban:read`
 * account rewrite the agent, the permission mode or the tools of its tasks.
 * TODO #787 extended it to the other Kanban writes: closing another task,
 * mark-merged, the worktree and merged-sha routes, pipelines. A mission keeps
 * closing the task it runs without it (`plugins-bundled/kanban/own-task.ts`).
 *
 * Verified developer-owner missions bypass this cap (agent-permissions.ts).
 * `missions:spawn` is deliberately absent: an injected agent must not
 * use the unrestricted spawn route. The separate delegation route checks a
 * running owned mission and explicit account communication/spawn denials.
 * It preserves the owner. Since TIM-0074 (11/10/2026) it also takes the
 * `model` / `backend` / `extra_*` / `idempotency_key` overrides, through
 * the same guard as a task a mission creates: refusing them left a mission no
 * way at all to use them. Both transports reach it in-mission — the MCP
 * `mission_spawn` and the CLI `timon spawn` (bin/timon `cmdSpawn`), which
 * since 12/10/2026 routes there instead of the unrestricted spawn route it
 * could never pass. `timon task` / `timon notify` stay in the cap.
 *
 * `agents:manage` / `projects:manage` entered the cap on 16/09/2026 (TIM-0013):
 * the runtime preamble sends an orchestrator to `POST /api/agents` and
 * `/api/projects`, and on every beta install (no `internal` licence, so no
 * developer-owner bypass) both answered 403. Still ∩ the launcher's grants —
 * an employee without them stays refused — and still non-privileged on the
 * route: `agentConfigRefusal` bounds what such a caller may put in an agent,
 * and a project cwd it creates must already exist on the host.
 *
 * `agents:privileged-config`: the power-user path of the override guards
 * (`privileged-overrides.ts`). Still ∩ the launcher's grants, so a superadmin's
 * missions carry it and an employee's do not; what it lifts is bounded by the
 * calling agent's own permission level.
 *
 * `skills:manage` entered the cap on 12/10/2026: the runtime preamble sends an
 * agent to `skill_put` / `skill_rm`, and the route answered 403 to every mission
 * (same shape as TIM-0013). Still ∩ the launcher's grants — an employee without
 * it stays refused — and bounded on the route (`skills-mcp-guard.ts`): a mission
 * writes `<skills>/<id>/SKILL.md` only, never a product skill, and cannot
 * pre-authorise tools it could not give an agent.
 *
 * `mcp:manage` entered it the same day, on the maintainer's decision (12/10/2026) to open
 * `mcp_server_put` / `mcp_server_rm` to agents. Still ∩ the launcher's grants,
 * and bounded on the route (`skills-mcp-guard.ts`, `mcpWriteRefusal`): a stdio
 * server is a command run on the host outside the permission classifier, so it
 * needs `agents:privileged-config` as well; an http one needs a plain http(s)
 * URL off this host; what Timon injects, what claude.ai discovered and what a
 * human declared are never rewritten. A mission token is never shown the secret
 * values of a server, `mcp:manage` or not.
 *
 * `triggers:manage` (TODO #216): an agent may create a trigger, but the
 * trigger's actions are frozen to what the token itself holds, and an agent
 * can never create an unauthenticated webhook (`plugins-bundled/triggers`).
 *
 * `missions:stop`: an orchestrator told "STOP" by its user must be able to
 * turn it into the technical stop (`POST /api/stop`). Owner-bounded like every
 * other row it touches, and a stop only switches things off.
