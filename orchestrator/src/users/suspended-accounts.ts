/**
 * Accounts whose access is suspended (free-access.ts), told to the superadmins
 * once (TODO #906, the maintainer's decision of 05/11/2026): without a pro licence or
 * without the Multi-user plugin, only the first superadmin stays active. The
 * other accounts keep their data; this card says so, and why, rather than
 * leaving the superadmin to find out from a teammate who cannot sign in.
 *
 * Idempotent through the notification anchor: a card already open is not raised
