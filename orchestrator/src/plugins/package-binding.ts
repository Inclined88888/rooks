/**
 * Which package holds a plugin id (TODO #671).
 *
 * What a human grants a plugin names its id: vault grants, `pluginPolicy` entries,
 * user connections and their keys. `rooks plugin remove` withdraws them, but a
 * package can leave otherwise (folder deleted, `npm uninstall`, a manifest
 * unreadable at removal), and the next package under that id, another author's
 * included, would inherit all of it. So the daemon remembers which package holds
 * each id, and withdraws everything the moment another one takes it, before any
 * of its code runs.
 *
 * Decided when a package SHOWS UP, never when one leaves: `npm` can take a package
 * off the disk for the length of an update, and a loader pass in that window would
 * destroy the keys of a plugin nobody removed (`PluginLoader.onRemoved` is not the
 * place). A package with no manifest or no admission never gets here either, so it
 * takes nothing away from anyone.
 *
 * The record is one row per id and survives a removal on purpose: a removal that
 * could not read the manifest purged nothing, and the record still catches the
 * next package. Webhook secrets are not handled here: they carry their own binding
 * (`webhooks.ts`, TODO #575) and ask for a regeneration instead of disappearing.
 *
 * A plugin's data outlives a removal by decision, so that a reinstall finds it,
 * but it was written by and for THAT package: when another one takes the id, it
 * gets none of it. Settings of type `secret` are deleted (TODO #675), then every
 * other setting and the free `plugin_kv`, and the data folder is moved aside
 * (TODO #677): a credential kept anywhere in there would otherwise change hands.
 * The folder goes to a dated trash rather than nowhere: the operator may still
 * want what the previous package wrote.
