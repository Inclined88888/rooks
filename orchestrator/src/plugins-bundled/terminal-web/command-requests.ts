/**
 * Command requests: a command an agent cannot run itself (`terminal_propose`:
 * sudo, a password, a rebuild that would kill its own mission), shown as a
 * card in its mission's conversation. The owner answers there:
 *   - `allow` — the agent runs it itself (only for a backend that can ask
 *     mid-turn: a `sandbox` one has its rights fixed at launch);
 *   - `paste` — the owner's browser opens the project's terminal and types the
 *     command WITHOUT Enter; the agent learns the user runs it;
 *   - `deny`.
 *
 * The answer comes back to the agent in its turn when it arrives within a
 * short wait (`waitForDecision`), otherwise as a message once its turn is
 * over (`deliverLate`). An unattended mission does not wait at all
 * (`expectLateAnswer`), yet still gets the answer while it runs. Nothing blocks
 * for long: a codex MCP call dies at 60 s, the MCP server's `fetch` at 300 s,
 * and an unattended mission must not wait for a human who is not there.
 *
 * Unlike a permission card, a request is not tied to its turn nor to its
 * mission: the coder proposes the rebuild, then closes its task, and the owner
 * still has the command to paste. It lives in the `command_requests` table,
 * and its two events (`command_request`, `command_request_resolved`) put it in
 * the conversation, for a page reloaded mid-request.
