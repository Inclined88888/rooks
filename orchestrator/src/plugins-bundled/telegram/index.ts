/**
 * Module `telegram` — the two inbound-channel workers, launched as child
 * processes of the daemon rather than by Docker.
 *
 * These are exactly the two Compose services `telegram-poll` and
 * `reply-worker`: the first long-polls the Telegram API and pushes each
 * message to the app's `/api/channels/<name>/inbound`, the second processes
 * the durable inbox, polls finished mission turns and retries replies to the
 * originating channel.
 *
 * **Name mismatch to know about**: the Compose service is called
 * `reply-worker` but runs `app/src/workers/mission-watcher.ts`. No
 * `reply-worker.ts` exists on disk. So we launch `mission-watcher.ts` (the
 * real file, the one Compose already refers to) and rename nothing: the
 * rename isn't part of this step.
 *
 * **Disabled by default** (plan §4.3.2). The workers currently run in
 * Compose; two Telegram pollers on the same bot would steal each other's
 * updates (the API only delivers each update once). An explicit gesture is
 * therefore required: `"@timon/telegram": { "enabled": true }` in
 * `timon.config.json`, after stopping the corresponding Compose services.
