/**
 * Moves an installed desktop service onto the release that was just installed.
 *
 * The service runs from a copy under `desktop-runtime/releases/`, so replacing
 * the application leaves it on the previous release until this runs. Order is
 * load-bearing: the previous release is marked inactive and pruned only once
 * the new daemon has ANSWERED. Any earlier failure puts the previous
 * definition back, so the daemon the user had keeps serving their data; when
 * there is none to put back, the new one is removed and the result asks for
 * the embedded daemon instead. `ROOKS_HOME` is never read or written here.
 *
 * Windows has no release copy to stage, mark or prune: its task runs straight
 * from the installation directory, and the NSIS update stops every `Rooks.exe`
 * before replacing those files. What an update can leave behind there is the
 * task DEFINITION (revision 1 died at logoff, backlog #141), so on Windows this
 * only rewrites the task, with the same restore-or-remove on failure; the
 * revision `installService` records is what marks it done.
