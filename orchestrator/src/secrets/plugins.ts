/**
 * What the vault exposes to plugins (SECRETS-VAULT.md §9.4).
 *
 * Two distinct things live here, and confusing them is how a value ends up in
 * the wrong place:
 *
 *  - **Vault entries** — rows of `secrets`, deposited by a human through
 *    `/secrets` or `rooks secret set`, read by a plugin through
 *    `ctx.secrets.get(name)`. The plugin never picks its own scope: it asks by
 *    name, and the grant decides whether an answer exists.
 *  - **Manifest settings of type `secret`** — values a user types in the
 *    plugin's own settings form. They stay in `plugin_kv` (that is where
 *    `ctx.settings` reads them) but are sealed with the same envelope as the
 *    vault, which is what closes the P.7 stub: before this module, they were
 *    written in the clear and therefore travelled in every `rooks export`.
 *
 * Neither path ever hands a value to a client: `settingStatus` keeps returning
 * `''`, and `ctx.secrets` is behind the `secrets:read` permission.

 * three scopes (§5.2) and inventing a fourth for plugins would mean a second
 * resolution path to keep correct. It is therefore addressed as the agent
 * `plugin:<id>`: a grant `agent:plugin:<id>` names one plugin and nothing else,
 * and no agent can ever carry that name — `secretScopeFor` compares the mission
 * agent, and a mission agent is a directory of `~/.rooks/agents/`.
 *
 * A `global` grant does NOT reach this address (`resolve.ts`, TODO #531,
 * decision 1-B): a plugin reads only what was granted to it by name, and
 * existing `global` grants are not copied over — that would undo the choice.
 * An install that relied on them gets a card instead (`globalOnlyCard`).
