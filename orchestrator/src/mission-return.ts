/**
 * Work return of a mission to its pilot — a single producer, one return per turn.
 *
 * Two moments send this return, and they must send exactly the same thing:
 *  - END OF TURN (`turn_complete` → `wake.ts handleMissionTurnComplete`): the
 *    nominal path for an autonomous mission WITHOUT a task. It is instant.
 *  - DEATH OF THE PROCESS (`agent.ts notifyParentOnComplete`): the fallback for
 *    a mission that never finished a turn — crash, SIGTERM mid-turn, kill.
 *
 * Before this module the second path was the ONLY one. With a persistent backend
 * (claude) the process does not die at the end of the turn: it waits for the idle
 * reap, `TIMON_REAP_IDLE_MS` (600 000 ms). Measured 11/09/2026 on two
 * `mission_spawn` delegations: turn done at 12:34 → return at 12:48, turn done at
 * 13:08 → return at 13:20. The pilot got its return ten minutes late, in the
 * middle of another conversation.
 *
 * The guard is `missions.return_notified`, the exact counterpart of
 * `tasks.return_notified`: set when the return goes out, cleared at the start of
 * every turn. A mission whose turn ended properly has already been reported; the
 * death that follows teaches nobody anything and must send NOTHING.
 *
 * The `mission_complete` BUS event is NOT touched here: `verification-loop.ts`,
 * `doc-task.ts`, `dispatcher.ts` and `librarian.ts` listen to it to create
 * follow-up work. Only the trigger of the MESSAGE enqueue moves.

 *    (self-notification is useless);
 *  - THIS mission's task already reported at closure (`tasks.return_notified`,
 *    posted by `wake.ts handleTaskDone` / `handleTaskBlocked`);
