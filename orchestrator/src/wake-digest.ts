 *
 *     ── Message 1 (de `TIMON.librarian`) — mission_complete ──
 *
 * while the payload in the database already carried task_id, task_title, task_status and
 * the complete `done_comment` (hence the review verdict). Two measured
 * consequences: a SQLite query after EACH return to find an info
 * it had in hand, and above all two empty returns for two different tasks
 * literally indistinguishable — that is what the "perceived
