/**
 * Doc-task creator: for each `merge` task (or `code` task without a review/merge pipeline)
 * that goes DONE, automatically creates a `doc` task assigned to the librarian
 * as a dependent. The doc task receives in its description a structured summary of the change
 * to guide the documentation in the knowledge vault (wiki/projects/<slug>/).
 *
 * Trigger: `task-chain.ts`, at the task's CLOSING (`task_done`), AFTER
 * the verification-loop has finished chaining a possible review/merge.
 *
 * That order is load-bearing and was NOT guaranteed before: both
 * modules listened to the same `mission_complete`, but the verification-loop yields
 * on an `await` (git diff) before creating the review, while this
 * handler decides synchronously. It therefore always won the
 * race and saw the `code` task as terminal: on 2026-08-21, the code task
 * `wake : des retours de mission…` received ITS doc at 08:00 then a second one through
 * its merge at 08:07. `task-chain.ts` now sequences the two steps.
 *
 * Idempotency: the `chain_ran` guard (task-chain) bounds the trigger to
 * once per task run; `hasDocTask` stays as a second curtain (doc created
 * by hand, reconciliation).
