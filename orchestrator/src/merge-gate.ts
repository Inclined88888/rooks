/**
 * Dispatch gate: evaluates a task's dependencies before spawn.
 *
 * Why this module exists ("shipping fees overhaul" incident, L1→L7, 29-30/07):
 * the dispatcher considered a dep satisfied as soon as it had the DONE status,
 * without ever looking at the VERDICT carried by a `review` dep. Yet the
 * project orchestrators pre-wire the pipeline (code→review→merge→verify linked
 * by `deps` from creation): the `merge` task therefore left just as well on a
 * `changes_requested` as on a review closed without any verdict. Result on
 * that job: 3 unvalidated merges, including a batch where two bugs (N+1 on the hot
 * checkout path, silent exclusion of products from free shipping) stayed
 * on main for a day.
 *
 * The verification-loop, for its part, was correct (it only creates a merge on
 * `pass`) — but it does not control the PRE-CREATED merges. Hence a structural
 * guarantee here, at the dispatch point, rather than prose instructions in
 * the task descriptions.
 *
 * No runtime import (types only): testable without opening SQLite.
