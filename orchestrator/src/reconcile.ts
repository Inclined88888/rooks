/**
 * Reconciliation loop: ROOKS's central guard.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * ROOKS is driven by events (`bus.emit`, synchronous, in-memory listeners).
 * An event is a single shot: if it gets lost — listener not registered yet,
 * orchestrator restart mid-flight, status not committed yet when the
 * handler reads the DB, task closed outside the end of a mission — the state stays
 * inconsistent FOREVER, and nothing reports it. The symptom is always the
 * same and always misleading: everything shows `DONE`, everything looks right, and the
 * work is not integrated.
 *
 * The pattern repeated itself often enough to stop being an accident:
 *   - 2026-05-25: merge tasks DONE without `merged_commit_sha` (branch never
 *     integrated) → `auditMergedTasksWithoutSha`.
 *   - IN_PROGRESS tasks whose mission had finished before the listeners
 *     were registered → `reconcileOrphanedTasks`.
 *   - 2026-08-04: `pass` review whose merge was never created, and librarian
 *     config never resynchronised with the code.
 *
 * Each had been patched in its own place, with its own cadence and its
 * own log style. This module gathers them: the system's invariants are
 * DECLARED here, in a single place, and a single loop checks them.
 *
 * ## The principle
 *
 * Do not ask "which event was lost?" but "what should the state
 * look like?". Each rule rebuilds the expected state and corrects the gap.
 * The rules must therefore be IDEMPOTENT: replaying them on a healthy system
 * must do nothing.
 *
 * ## Adding a rule
 *
 * Write the function in the module that owns the domain (dispatcher for the
 * tasks, librarian for its config…), then:
 *   - generic Kanban invariant, without an optional dependency → `RULES` below;
 *   - invariant of a module that may not be loaded (git, grepai, embedded
 *     browser) → `registerReconcileRule()`, called by the module itself.
 * This module must import ONLY `dispatcher`, `task-chain` and `worktree-gc`:
 * importing `grepai` or `browser-sessions` from here would make reconciliation —
 * hence the boot — depend on modules that can be disabled.
 * Choose the cadence with care — see `ReconcileCadence`.

 * When a rule runs.

 *   only drift between two boots.
 * - `interval`: periodically. For the drifts that appear during the
 *   process's life, while the orchestrator runs.
