/**
 * Attachments of a chat turn — everything that is not an image.
 *
 * An image goes inline in the turn (protocol `image` block): the model
 * sees it. A PDF, a .pptx, a .csv have no equivalent — the CLIs that
 * Rooks drives read FILES. So the bytes are persisted under
 * `$ROOKS_HOME/uploads/chat/<uuid>/` and their absolute paths are announced to
 * the agent, which opens them with its own tools.
 *
 * The folder carries the MISSION'S ID, one subfolder per turn. That is what
 * makes a cleanup possible: the lifetime of an attachment is that of its
 * mission, not an age in days. A blind purge, on the date alone, can
 * always take away the file of a mission still alive — and a "finished"
 * mission is not finished for good, `respawnWithResume` reopens it
 * (`reopenMission` sets `status='running'`, `ended_at=NULL` again). See
 * `purgeChatAttachments`.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences with `uploads.ts`, and that is why this module
 * is separate:
 *  - No type allowlist. The request is "any type without
 *    exception"; the guard therefore moves to the NAME (basename, no
 *    separator, no `..`, bounded length), not to the content.
 *  - No serving route. These bytes are never served again over HTTP:
 *    the agent reads them on disk, the bubble only shows the name. Nothing to
 *    sniff, nothing to render inline.
