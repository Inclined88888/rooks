/**
 * Wake-loop: wakes the orchestrator (ROOKS.main / _main) at the right time.
 *
 * Problem solved: the orchestrator is fire-and-forget — it creates tasks
 * then its mission dies. `notifyParentOnComplete` (agent.ts) already queues
 * recaps in its inbox, but NOTHING wakes it to read them → messages
 * pile up on a dead agent. This module listens on the bus and re-spawns
 * the orchestrator (resuming ITS session, hence its plan context) when:
 *
 *   - `task_blocked`      → near-immediate wake with the blockage recap.
 *                           The orchestrator then decides (re-queue, reassign,
 *                           spawn a diagnostic coder, abandon, escalate to the user).
 *   - `task_done`         → the work return is sent AT TASK CLOSURE
 *                           (handleTaskDone), not at the death of the process
 *                           that ran it: that death sometimes arrives 10 min
 *                           later (reviewer missions, which stay `running`
 *                           until the idle reap). `notifyParentOnComplete`
 *                           (agent.ts) becomes the fallback for missions without
 *                           a task, and stays silent when the return has already
 *                           been delivered (`tasks.return_notified`).
 *   - end of batch        → `evaluateGroupCompleteForTask`, called by
 *                           `task-chain.ts` at closure of the group's last task:
 *                           if THIS group has no active task left
 *                           (`groupHasActiveTasks` false, scoped to the group) and
 *                           has not already been notified (`isGroupNotified`) → wake
 *                           with a consolidated recap (N done / M blocked), then
 *                           `markGroupNotified`. Tasks without a group_id do NOT
 *                           trigger a DONE wake (legacy unchanged).
 *   - `mission_complete`  → safety net for end-of-batch only, and therefore a no-op
 *                           in the nominal case (`isGroupNotified` already set).
 *
 * Routing by mission (2026-07-28) — FIRST RULE:
 *   A message that carries a `to_mission` is delivered IN THAT MISSION, not in
 *   a new one. That mission launched the work, so it alone has the plan in
 *   context. It is resurrected if needed (`respawnWithResume`, same missionId,
 *   same provider session) regardless of its age.
 *   Founding incident (2026-07-27): `acme.main` splits a project into
 *   4 sub-missions; at the end of the 1st, the wake-loop spawns a NEW `.main`
 *   which, lacking the plan, derives its own "mission 2/4" different from the
 *   one that had just been launched. Three concurrent orchestrators, diverging
 *   plan. `to_mission` had been stored in the database all along
 *   (`notifyParentOnComplete`) — nobody was reading it.
 *   Spawning a fresh wake mission remains the fallback: messages without
 *   `to_mission`, target mission without a resumable session, or target busy
 *   for too long (see MAX_ROUTE_DEFERRALS).
 *
 * Hard guards:
 *   - Single-flight: a wake mission already in flight for this agent blocks
 *     any new flush (entry in `wakeMissions`). WARNING: this is NOT an
 *     `isRunning` test — a live chat mission of the same agent blocks
 *     nothing (see flushWakeInner). That is exactly what allowed the fork in
 *     the incident above; routing by mission is what fixes it, not this guard.
 *   - Debounce: events in a short window are aggregated before waking,
 *     to absorb bursts of task completions (MAX_PARALLEL=3).
 *   - Anti-infinite-wake: blocked-wake counter per group + cooldown reset.
 *     Past the threshold → escalate to the user directly (notifyUser) instead of
 *     re-waking, to break a re-queue → re-block → wake loop.
 *   - Wake economy: a return that calls for no decision (the chain continues
 *     on its own, or it is a `doc` task) does not consume an orchestrator turn
 *     by itself — it is HELD and merged into the next digest (see
 *     splitByUrgency / DEFERRED_HOLD_MS). A BLOCKED task, a `changes_requested`
 *     verdict or a merge always wake.
 *
 * The wake-loop NEVER rebuilds/restarts the orchestrator: it spawns a mission
 * UNDER the current orchestrator.
 *
 * Wiring: `startWake()` at boot, after `startRecovery()` / `startDispatcher()`.
