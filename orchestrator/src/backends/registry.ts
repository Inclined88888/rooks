/**
 * LIVING registry of the LLM backends (§10.15).
 *
 * It used to fit in two constants evaluated at import (`ACTIVE_PROFILES` in
 * the old `./profiles.ts`, `REGISTRY` in `./index.ts`). That was enough as long as
 * "adding a provider" meant "editing the repo": the orchestrator's env
 * does not move during its life, nor does the list.
 *
 * Open-core breaks that assumption: a third-party plugin brings its provider
 * (zAI, Qwen…) and can be installed, enabled, disabled and removed **without a
 * restart**. A constant would freeze the list at the boot state; the
 * dispatcher would refuse a freshly installed backend, and would keep
 * accepting that of an unloaded plugin.
 *
 * Hence: a mutable state, a cache invalidated on each mutation, and readers
 * that call a function instead of reading a constant. The cost is that
 * of a `map` over a handful of profiles, paid only when the cache is
 * cold.
 *
 * The registry holds NO credential value: it memorises the shape
 * of the profiles, and the env is resolved at each spawn (`./credentials.ts`). The
 * visibility itself is read again on each read — a key that appears during
 * the process's life activates its profile without a mutation or a restart.
 *
 * What the registry NEVER delegates to a plugin: launching the process
 * (`host.spawn` stays with the daemon), allowing the binary (`host:exec` policy),
 * and deciding a profile's visibility (missing credentials make it
 * inactive, exactly like a profile of the repo).
