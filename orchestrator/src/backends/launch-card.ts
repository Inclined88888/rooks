 * error only, and the operator had to work out where the re-authorization lives. The card names the
 * backend and the reason, and opens Settings › AI models › Backends on the provider
 * (`notificationHref`, `provider-launch:<pluginId>`), where the authorization is a click on a dialog
 * that shows the path the DAEMON resolved. The card informs; it never authorizes anything itself.
 *
 * One card per plugin and process, replacing the previous boot's rather than stacking: a provider that
 * keeps failing at every turn must not bury the centre. A launch of that plugin that goes through, or an
 * authorization given from the providers page, closes it.
