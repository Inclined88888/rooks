/**
 * An ACP agent as DATA (`docs/PROVIDERS-SDK.md` § 7.1, § 10.2): the table `AGENTS`
 * of the old `acp` dialect was closed — three rows in the core — and each new agent
 * meant a branch in the protocol code. Here an agent is a row a plugin writes
 * (`official-providers/provider-acp/lib/agents.js` carries opencode, Hermes and Pi):
 * the command that puts the binary in ACP mode, whether the agent arbitrates its
 * own tool uses, and the few things only it knows. The protocol — transport,
 * session driver, event mapper, permissions through the card and the classifier —
 * is the daemon's, supplied through `ctx.provider.runtime.acp`.
 *
 *   const runtime = ctx.provider.runtime;
 *   ctx.provider.registerProvider(runtime.acp.defineProvider(ctx.provider, {
 *     id: 'cursor', args: ['acp'], binary: { names: ['cursor-agent', 'agent'] },
 *   }));
 *
 * What an agent's own quirks need beyond a row is a hook in ITS plugin, never a
 * branch here (Orca's rule: "the lifecycle and the identity of the lines stay
 * shared"). The Timon MCP servers of the session come from `services.mcp`
 * (S1), so the identity travels as a reference the daemon swaps on the pipe.
 *
 * Leaf: the driver is given pipes, never a process.
