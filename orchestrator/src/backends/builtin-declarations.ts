/**
 * What the product's OWN providers declare about themselves, as data
 * (`docs/PROVIDERS-SDK.md` § 4, volets 5b and 7).
 *
 * The core used to name each provider where it needed one: the npm package of a
 * CLI, the folders its installer writes to, the folder its sign-in lives in, the
 * model tiers, the order of the automatic fallback. Those declarations now live in
 * the manifest of the official provider plugin that brings each backend
 * (`timon.provider.backends` of its `package.json`), in the vocabulary a provider
 * plugin writes (C1 to C5) plus the fields only the product reads (setup card,
 * sign-in hint, logo fragments, standalone installer…). The core reads them the
 * same way whoever shipped the provider: `profileDeclarations(id)` answers from the
 * registered provider first, from these declarations second.
 *
 * Why the manifest and not the plugin's code: the doctor, the binary search, the
 * mission isolation and the onboarding need them BEFORE the plugin loader runs (and
 * for a provider plugin switched off), and a manifest can be read synchronously
 * without running anything. Only the built-in plugins the release vouches for are
 * read (`plugins/builtin.ts`): a field here can run an installer or spare a folder.
 *
 * Keyed by BACKEND id, not by dialect: `opencode` and `hermes` share the ACP
 * runtime and have nothing else in common, `kimi` and `ollama-cloud` ride on
 * `claude` and `codex` with a sign-in folder of their own.
