/**
 * Catalogue of the LLM backends and their models, DERIVED from the active profiles.
 *
 * The data itself lives in the registered profiles (a profile = "which
 * binary, which env, which models"); this module only keeps the
 * "display + resolution" view of it. Direct consequence: a profile disabled for lack
 * of credentials appears nowhere, without conditional code on the UI side.
 *
 * It is the single view for "which backends exist, which
 * models they serve, how they are displayed". It feeds:
 *   - `backendForModel()` (the dispatcher's anti-mismatch guard) through an exact
 *     lookup of the slug — no more regex guessing on the shape of the slug;
 *   - the `GET /api/backends/catalog` API, which the UI consumes at runtime to
 *     build its menus (the UI no longer redeclares the list at build time).
 *
 * Adding a model = adding an entry in the matching profile, and nothing
 * else: it appears in the UI's menus AND becomes resolvable by the
 * dispatcher.
 *
 * A backend of the catalogue is not necessarily served by a first-party CLI: a
 * custom provider profile declares its models with `custom: true`, or
 * declares none (`models: []`) when the upstream list is not known. The UI must
 * tolerate an empty list.
