/**
 * Automatic backend switchover when a quota runs dry.
 *
 * FOUNDING INCIDENT (2026-08-20). Right in the middle of a job,
 * the account's Claude quota ran out. Every task in the series was running on
 * other backends (grok for code, codex for review/merge) — those were fine.
 * But two actors were still on Claude: the librarian and, above all, THE
 * ORCHESTRATOR, the one every task return goes back to. Its mission died on
 * the usage limit. The next task return woke a fresh `.main`, which died on
 * the same limit. Then the next one. Result: a cascade of dead missions, no
 * return processed, and a job stopped dead while half the fleet still had
 * quota left.
 *
 * Two distinct causes, both handled here:
 *
 *  1. NO FALLBACK. A dry backend was not a state the system knew about: every
 *     spawn drove straight back into the wall. So we keep a registry of
 *     exhausted quotas (`backend_cooldowns`, in the database — restarting the
 *     orchestrator does not reopen a provider's quota) and a single,
 *     configurable backup backend (`ROOKS_FALLBACK_BACKEND`).
 *
 *  2. THE SERIES SCATTERS. Every return woke a brand-new mission, hence an
 *     orchestrator with no plan in mind — that is no longer orchestration. So
 *     the switchover acts at the SERIES level (`tasks.series_id`), not the
 *     task level: we swap the pilot mission's backend WITHOUT changing its id
 *     (`switchMissionBackend` replays the transcript: same thread, different
 *     CLI), and repoint every non-terminal task of the series at that pilot.
 *
 * Three families of exclusion live here, and each has its own lifetime because
 * each says something different about when the backend comes back:
 * `rate_limit` (a window that reopens on its own, see rate-limit.ts),
 * `exhausted` (an account with no credit, only a top-up brings it back), and
 * `unavailable` (the circuit breaker of `backend-breaker.ts` observed N sterile
 * turns; the cause is unknown, so the exclusion is the shortest). None is
 * permanent: `isBackendCoolingDown` gates the spawns too, so an exclusion with
 * no end would seal itself shut — nothing would ever run there again to prove
 * it is back.

 * only applies if its target is WORKABLE (known to the catalog, different from
 * what we are fleeing, and not dry itself); otherwise we drop to the next one —
 * "otherwise" means otherwise, an unworkable fallback must not make the whole
 * cascade fail:
 *
 *   1. `taskOverride` — a decision made when ONE task was created
 *      (`--fallback-backend`), the most specific there is;
 *   2. SERIES RULE (`rooks series fallback set`) — the orchestrator's decision,
 *      since it knows its job: what calibre for the code, which small model for
 *      the reviews, what for itself;
 *   2 bis. THE PILOT ONLY (`orchestrator` scope): another connection of the
 *      same provider its owner holds — the host's sign-in, one of their
 *      accounts, one granted to them — same model;
 *   3. EQUIVALENCE MATRIX (`equivalence.ts`) — absent any decision, the model
 *      closest to the one being left behind. It comes BEFORE the fixed setting
 *      (2026-08-22): a single global fallback demotes everyone to the same
 *      place, whereas equivalence preserves the original calibre. An opus that
 *      falls deserves an opus-class model, not the account default.
 *   4. FIXED SETTING (`ROOKS_FALLBACK_BACKEND`) — last resort, when equivalence
 *      finds nothing (model unknown to the matrix, all equivalents dry).
 *
 * The two refusal sentinels stay hard stops, never an "otherwise":
 * `taskOverride.backend === 'none'` and a series rule with a null backend both
 * say "I would rather it stopped than continued somewhere else".
 *
 * ACCOUNTS (TODO #52, amended by TODO #701 on 31/10/2026). A subscription
 * account is a choice of subscription: for a TASK, only a fallback someone
 * declared (levels 1-2) may move it, never the automatic levels. The PILOT is
 * the exception. On 31/10/2026 `rooks.main` ran dry on `claude@aeeca8b0ac`,
 * its series rule named that same account, and the guard stopped the cascade
 * there: pilot not swapped, every wake refused, while the host's `claude` and
 * `codex` still had quota. The pilot holds the plan of the whole job and
 * receives every return; leaving it dead stops the job, which is worse than
 * moving it to another subscription its owner holds. So for the `orchestrator`
 * scope the cascade goes on: level 2 bis first (same provider, so the same
 * model and a transcript the CLI reads natively), then 3 and 4. Never to
 * another user's account (`ownConnections`). A pilot that still finds nothing

 * well be running on a backend that still has quota.
 *
 * Idempotent: called again on an already switched series, it finds nothing
 * left to change and does not notify a second time.
 *
 * `ruleScope` (set only by `rooks series fallback set`, see
 * `applySeriesFallbackRule`) narrows the switchover to what the rule just
 * posted actually governs. Without it, setting one rule for `code` would
 * silently repoint review, merge and doc too — each of them resolving through
 * the wildcard, the equivalence matrix or the global setting, none of which the
 * human just asked for. The automatic path passes nothing and keeps its
 * whole-series behaviour for the TASKS: it fires because a backend really is
 * dry, and then everything that depends on it has to move. The pilot is the
 * exception: it moves only when its own backend is dry (`pilotIsGoverned`).
 *
 * `respawnDeadPilot: false` (set by the boot reconciliation, see
 * `reconcileOrphanedTasks`) repoints a pilot that is NOT running instead of
 * switching it: `switchMissionBackend` reopens the mission and spawns a turn,
 * which at boot would resurrect an orchestrator nobody asked to restart — a
 * whole series' worth of them, on a daemon that has just come up. A pilot still
 * running is switched normally, flag or not.
 *
 * What repointing buys, exactly: any path that spawns a turn on THAT mission id
 * reads `missions.backend_override` (cf. `resolveConfig` in `agent.ts`), so it
 * leaves on the fallback instead of the dry backend. What it does NOT buy: an
 * in-place resume by the wake loop, since we clear the session — it belonged to
 * the CLI we are leaving, and `--resume`ing it on another provider fails at
 * launch. The wake loop then starts a fresh mission for that agent, where the
 * backend cooldown decides. Unlike `switchMissionBackend`, no transcript is
 * handed over: this path spawns nothing, so it has nowhere to hand it to. Its
 * `backend_switch` event says the context is still owed (`pending`), which is
 * what sends it with the next message written in the thread.

 * Applies a fallback rule POSTED BY HAND, right now, to a series already

 * (`setSeriesLlmOverride` + requeue) lived solely in the automatic path, on an
 * interruption that says "the backend shut down". So the rule the maintainer posted at
 * 22:06 changed nothing — the next task left on the dry backend anyway, hit
 * another 402, and each blocked task had to have its `backend_override`
 * rewritten by hand, one at a time.
 *
 * DECISION: applying is the DEFAULT, and it is unconditional on the tasks. Not
 * gated on the backend being known-dry, because the human posts a rule exactly
 * when automatic detection did NOT fire — gating the manual escape hatch on the
 * automatic path having worked defeats its purpose. Naming a scope and a
 * backend IS the decision. Before a chantier starts the series has no
 * PENDING/BLOCKED task, so the default is a no-op there; `apply: false` remains
 * available for recording a plan while explicitly touching nothing.
 *
 * What it does NOT do: it never moves a task in flight (`switchSeriesToFallback`
 * only ever touches PENDING/BLOCKED), never touches a type the rule does not
 * govern, and never swaps a healthy pilot unless the rule names
 * `orchestrator`.
