/**
 * Integrity check of a merge: did it erase work that did not
 * belong to it?
 *
 * FOUNDING INCIDENT (2026-08-20). On a job of 170 tasks in
 * 14 h, three commits on `main` erased the work freshly integrated by
 * others — including one titled (in French) "chore: validate the local changes
 * before integration", which on its own deleted 2,800 lines of analytics and
 * product.* merged an hour earlier.
 *
 * The cause is mechanical and has nothing of a reasoning fault: several
 * mergers converged on the main repo, which has only ONE working
 * directory. One saw the other's intermediate state there, took it for
 * "local changes" and committed it. The merge lock and the dedicated
 * worktree (see `dispatcher.ts`) remove that collision; this module is the
 * net for anything that would still get through — a wholesale `git checkout --ours`,
 * an unfortunate `reset`, a conflict resolved the wrong way round.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: block. A BLOCKED task stays stuck until
 * a human sees it, which is exactly the failure mode we
 * seek to eliminate. A broken integrity therefore relaunches the SAME task with the
 * list of the erased files — the agent restores and retries by itself, as it
 * already does for a `changes_requested` verdict. The user is only called on after
 * `MAX_REPAIRS` attempts.
