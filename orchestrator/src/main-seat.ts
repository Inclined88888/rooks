/**
 * Keeps the cross-project orchestrator seat filled, or says that it is not.
 *
 * `mainAgentName()` is a pure read, run on every recap: it found the seat by
 * the recorded name, a seed literal, or — when only one project-less
 * orchestrator exists — by role. Nothing ever wrote that last answer down, and
 * nothing said when there was no answer at all. A tester rebuilt their
 * database with the agent folders restored and no `_main`: four days with
 * `main: false` on every agent, recaps addressed to a name nothing reads, and
 * not one word about it (TIM-0142).
 *
 * So, at boot and whenever an agent that could hold the seat changes:
 * - a holder found by role is recorded, so a second orchestrator created later
 *   does not empty the seat behind the user's back;
 * - an empty seat with exactly one candidate is given to it;
 * - otherwise the seat stays empty — choosing among several is the user's
 *   call — and a card says so, once per empty spell rather than at every boot.
 *
 * Nothing is written while the first-run wizard is pending: it seeds and names
 * the orchestrator itself, and a recorded key reads to it as "name step
 * answered" (`mainAgentNamed` in `onboarding-main-agent.ts`).
