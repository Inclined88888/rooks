/**
 * Post-closing chaining: when a task goes DONE, everything it must
 * trigger leaves IMMEDIATELY.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * `verification-loop.ts` (review / merge / next iteration) and `doc-task.ts`
 * both listened to `mission_complete`. That event is NOT emitted when
 * the agent closes its task: it is when its PROCESS dies, so at the idle reap —
 * `ROOKS_REAP_IDLE_MS` is 600,000 ms (settings.ts). Measured on 2026-08-21:
 * review `98e28f1a` closed at 09:47:28 with `changes_requested`, mission already
 * without a living process, code task iter:2 created at **09:58** — 11 minutes of
 * empty Kanban, during which the user believed the job was finished. That delay was
 * systematic on every code → review → merge → doc chain.
 *
 * The trigger is now `task_done`, published BY the write that sets
 * status=DONE (`dbApi.updateTaskStatus` / `setTaskStatusOnly`). Two properties
 * follow for free:
 *   - the status is in the database by construction when our handlers run, so
 *     the constraint "register after `startDispatcher()`" disappears;
 *   - `mission_complete` no longer chains anything. It keeps its only remaining
 *     use: the mission dead WITHOUT closing its task (crash, kill, agent that
 *     never closed) — the dispatcher's `watchMissionComplete` path, intact.
 *
 * ## Why a dedicated module, and not two listeners
 *
 * The order between the two steps is load-bearing: the verification-loop yields
 * on an `await` (git diff) before creating the review, whereas doc-task
 * decided synchronously. On the same event, doc-task therefore always
 * won the race and saw the `code` task as terminal: on
 * 2026-08-21 the code task of the `wake` job received ITS doc at 08:00, then a
 * second one through its merge at 08:07. Here the steps are AWAITED one after
 * the other — terminality and group completion are evaluated on a
 * Kanban where what follows already exists.
 *
 * ## Why `setImmediate`
 *
 * `task_done` is published INSIDE the DB write that caused it
 * (`bus.emit` is synchronous). A synchronous handler would therefore write to the database in
 * the middle of that write, and nothing guarantees no caller has
 * wrapped it in a `db.transaction`. One event tick is enough to leave
 * that context — that is ~0 ms, to compare with the 600,000 ms of the reap.
 *
 * That tick is NO LONGER a budget. It used to be: the wake-loop enqueued the work
 * return as soon as `task_done` but only evaluated the urgency at the flush, 1 s later
 * (`DEBOUNCE_MS`), through `hasFollowUpTask` — so the chain had to have created its
 * follow-up task by then. It was a bet on git's latency: `handleCodeDone`
 * starts with a `git diff --stat` in a subprocess (5 s timeout), which goes past the
 * second on a cold worktree. That bet is replaced by an explicit signal
 * (`chain-barrier.ts`): the barrier is opened SYNCHRONOUSLY on receiving
 * `task_done`, and the wake-loop's flush waits for it before deciding. A slow
 * `await` at the head of `runTaskChain` therefore no longer wakes anyone wrongly.

 * while no listener is listening — typically an orchestrator restart
 * mid-flight, which is nothing hypothetical here (chronic OOM, V8 heap cap
 * at 4 GB). Before the switch to `task_done`, that case was caught by the
 * boot's zombie sweep, which republishes `mission_complete`; that is no longer true,
 * since the dispatcher exits early on a task already DONE and so emits no
 * `task_done`.
 *
 * Two states are picked up, and that is the heart of the net:
 *   - `CHAIN_NEVER`: the chain never left (the event got lost);
 *   - `CHAIN_RUNNING` for more than `CHAIN_STALE_MS`: the chain left and
 *     never finished. That case was INVISIBLE as long as the flag was a
 *     boolean set before the first await: a SIGTERM, an OOM or a restart
 *     between the setting and the end left the task marked "chained" without it
 *     having produced anything, and nothing caught it any more — ever. The net was
 *     blind to the very scenario that gave birth to it.
